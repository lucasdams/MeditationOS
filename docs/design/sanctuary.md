The Sanctuary is the product's retention loop: a small **spend economy**. You earn
**coins** as you level up and spend them to **buy** items (plants, structures, pets) and
**upgrade** them through visual tiers (tree → flowering → old oak). The loop is *earn →
choose → upgrade*.

> Previously this was a *cultivation* model — grow one thing at a time by practicing,
> no currency. That's [ADR-0010](../decisions/0010-sanctuary-cultivation.md), now
> superseded by [ADR-0011](../decisions/0011-sanctuary-spend-economy.md).

## Core principle

Coins come from your **level**, which is computed from **earned XP** — total XP minus
the streak bonus. Excluding the volatile streak bonus keeps coins **monotonic**: a lapsed
streak never takes coins (or bought items) away, so the garden never regresses. Because
level rises with *all* XP-earning activity, meditation, breathing, gratitude, and journal
all contribute to coins.

The only stored state is **what you own and each item's tier** (plus one small economy
counter, below). Spending is *derived from holdings* — there's no wallet row or transaction
log:

```
coins_earned = level × COINS_PER_LEVEL          (level from earned XP)
coins_spent  = Σ owned (buy_cost + variant_delta + Σ customization_costs + progressive_surcharge(position))
balance      = max(0, coins_earned − coins_spent − sanctuary_reset_fees)
```

`sanctuary_reset_fees` is the **one stored coin figure** — a per-user counter of the flat
fees paid to **reset** an item's upgrades ([ADR-0019](../decisions/0019-sanctuary-reset-upgrades-for-a-fee.md)).
Everything else stays derived from holdings. It only ever increases (monotonic, like
`coins_earned`), so it can never retroactively raise an existing garden's balance.

The **progressive surcharge** ([ADR-0013](../decisions/0013-sanctuary-progressive-pricing.md))
makes each *additional* item cost more: the k-th item a user acquires (0-indexed by its
stable `position`) pays `round(PROGRESSIVE_STEP × k)` on top of its catalog price — the
first item pays nothing extra, each later one a linearly growing premium. It is a
deterministic function of the holding's ordinal alone, so the balance is still **fully
derived from holdings** — no wallet, no ledger.

## The loop

```
level up → coins → buy an item (or upgrade one you own) → it joins / improves the garden
```

## Personalization (variants + customizations)

A single linear tier ladder per item barely changed the art. The garden now personalizes
on two axes ([ADR-0012](../decisions/0012-sanctuary-personalization.md)), preserving the
derived-balance principle of ADR-0011:

- **Variant** — a base form chosen *at purchase*: a tree species (oak/pine/cherry/willow),
  a dog breed (corgi/husky/shiba/dalmatian), a flower type, a cat colour, a wall colour…
  The variant visibly changes the drawn SVG. `null` = the item's default (first) variant.
- **Customizations** — independent, named **slots**, each with options, bought over time
  and mixed and matched: a tree can have `foliage` ∈ {fruit, blossom, autumn} *and* a
  `swing` *and* a `birdhouse`; a dog can be grown *and* wear a `tiny_crown` *and* a `bell`
  collar *and* `sunglasses`. Slots are independent — applying one never replaces another.
  Within a slot, switching the chosen option charges only the difference, so it is never
  punishing.

The old `tier` is folded into the `grown` size slot, which is now a **multi-stage growth
ladder** ([ADR-0019](../decisions/0019-sanctuary-growth-ladder-and-accessory-slots.md)): four
sequential, mutually-exclusive stages — `grown → flourishing → mature → ancient` — each
costlier and gated at a higher level, and each visibly larger/lusher in the SVG. The first
rung is keyed literally `"grown"` at the unchanged cost `round(base × 1.5)`, so existing rows
(`customizations = {"grown": "grown"}`) resolve and their spend is preserved exactly with no
break; advancing a stage charges only the difference (a within-slot swap). The characters also
gain additive **dress-up slots** — `headwear` (hat / flower crown / tiny crown), `collar`
(bandana / bow tie / bell), and `attire` (scarf / sunglasses) — independent of each other and
of the legacy `accessory` slot. The catalog is in-code, so all of this needs no migration.

### Character & whimsy (ADR-0016)

Beyond the plants, structures, and pets, a **whimsy** track adds characterful garden friends
and curios — a garden gnome, a toadstool ring, a wind chime, a lantern, a frog on a lily, a
scarecrow, a fairy door, a hammock, and a premium tea cart — each with its own variants and
customization slots and full SVG art. Each catalog item also carries an optional cosmetic
`blurb`: a short, calm flavour line surfaced quietly in the shop (a quiet italic line + a
hover tooltip). Personality lives in the art and the blurbs, never in nags or noise — a quiet
smile, in keeping with the app's low-pressure stance.

## Data model

One table — the holdings; the balance is computed.

```
sanctuary_plantings
  id              UUID            pk
  user_id         UUID            fk users ON DELETE CASCADE
  item_key        TEXT            -- references SANCTUARY_CATALOG (in code)
  position        INT             -- immutable acquisition order: 0, 1, 2, … (economy key)
  cell            INT             -- grid layout slot, row-major; rearranged freely (layout)
  variant         TEXT NULL       -- chosen base form; NULL = the item's default variant
  customizations  JSONB           -- {slot: option} purchased; default '{}'
  name            VARCHAR(40) NULL    -- user plaque/nickname; NULL = unnamed (cosmetic)
  note            VARCHAR(140) NULL   -- short free-text caption/memory; NULL = none (cosmetic)
  favorite        BOOLEAN         -- pin flag; default false (cosmetic)
  created_at      timestamptz     server default now()
  UNIQUE (user_id, position)
  UNIQUE (user_id, cell)
  INDEX (user_id)
```

`name`, `note`, and `favorite` ([ADR-0015](../decisions/0015-sanctuary-personalization-touches.md))
are **purely cosmetic** personal touches — all optional and default-off. They never enter the
spend computation below, so naming/noting/pinning an item can never change coins, and they are
independent of `cell` (layout). `name`/`note` are trimmed and length-capped server-side (40 /
140 chars; empty → NULL); over-length input is rejected as `422`.

Still no `user_wallet` and no spend ledger — the holdings *are* the ledger
([ADR-0011](../decisions/0011-sanctuary-spend-economy.md)). `item_key` may repeat. The old
`tier` INT column was migrated into `customizations.grown` and dropped.

`position` and `cell` are deliberately separate
([ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-sanctuary-grid-layout.md)). `position` is the **immutable
acquisition order** the progressive surcharge is keyed off (ADR-0013), so it must never be
reordered — moving an item by rewriting `position` would silently re-price the garden and
shift balances. `cell` is a **layout-only** row-major grid index the user rearranges by
dragging; it has no effect on cost. New items are bought into the lowest free cell;
existing gardens backfilled `cell = position`, so they keep their prior order as the
initial layout.

## Catalog (in-code constant)

`SANCTUARY_CATALOG` is the single source of truth for what can be grown — keyed like
`SESSION_TYPES` and the gratitude `CATEGORIES`. Each entry:

| field | meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `key` | stable id stored in `sanctuary_plantings.item_key` |
| `track` | `nature` · `structure` · `companion` · `whimsy` |
| `cost` | coins to **buy** (default variant, no customizations) |
| `unlock_level` | level required before it appears in the shop |
| `variants` | selectable base forms (each with an optional `cost_delta` + `unlock_level`) |
| `slots` | customization slots → `{option: cost}` (+ optional per-option `unlock_level`) |
| `blurb` | a short, calm flavour line shown in the shop tooltip / plaque (cosmetic; ADR-0016) |
| `suggested_names` | a small pool of on-character example names offered as a naming suggestion — placeholder + 🎲 shuffle (cosmetic; ADR-0015) |

The shipped catalog (buy cost / variants / customization slots). The **whimsy** track and a
couple of nature/companion additions were added in [ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-sanctuary-shop-expansion-and-retune.md):

Variants are free in the shipped catalog (a per-variant `cost_delta` is supported for
future tuning). All costs are tunable constants — retuning needs no migration.
`COINS_PER_LEVEL = 80` ([ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-sanctuary-shop-expansion-and-retune.md)).
Each item also carries a cosmetic `blurb`.

The `grown·N` column above is the **first rung** of the `grown` slot's growth ladder
([ADR-0019](../decisions/0019-sanctuary-growth-ladder-and-accessory-slots.md)) — the
unchanged `"grown"` stage at `round(base_size × 1.5)`. The slot continues into three further
stages at rising cost (× `2.4 / 3.6 / 5.0` of `base_size`) and rising unlock level (`3 / 5 /
8`): `grown → flourishing → mature → ancient`. The companion/whimsy characters also carry
additive **`headwear`** (hat / flower crown / tiny crown), **`collar`** (bandana / bow tie /
bell), and **`attire`** (scarf / sunglasses) slots alongside the legacy `accessory` slot — all
in-code, no migration.

### Progressive pricing (ADR-0013, retuned in ADR-0016)

Buy costs were lowered (~25%) and `COINS_PER_LEVEL` raised 50 → 70 (ADR-0013), then 70 → **80**
([ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-sanctuary-shop-expansion-and-retune.md)) to keep mid-level
progress rewarding under the front-loaded XP curve (coins accrue slowly for longer sits). On
top of the catalog price, each *additional* item carries a **progressive surcharge**
`round(PROGRESSIVE_STEP × position)` with `PROGRESSIVE_STEP = 6` (8 → 6 in ADR-0016, a gentler
anti-hoarding tax; position = the item's 0-indexed acquisition order). The first item pays
nothing extra; the
second 8; the third 16; and so on. The surcharge is applied identically at read (the spent
computation) and at write (the `buy` affordability check), and a swap of a customization
*within a slot* still charges only the option difference (the surcharge is per-item, not
per-customization).

The cheaper base + higher `COINS_PER_LEVEL` offset the early surcharge so small/typical
gardens are never worse off; only larger gardens pay meaningfully more. Example garden of
N identical trees (old flat buy = 40, new buy = 30 + surcharge):

| items | old `coins_spent` | new `coins_spent` | balance @ lvl 6 (old→new) |
|------:|------------------:|------------------:|---------------------------|
| 1 | 40 | 30 | 260 → 390 |
| 3 | 120 | 114 | 180 → 306 |
| 6 | 240 | 300 | 60 → 120 |
| 10 | 400 | 660 | 0 → 0 |

Small gardens (1–3) are cheaper in raw spend; even where a larger garden's raw spend rises
(6, 10), the balance at a fixed level never drops below the old economy (clamped ≥ 0), so no
existing garden is punished.

## Computed state

In `sanctuary_service`, from the user's level (via `dashboard_service.get_stats`, on
**earned XP**) and the stored holdings:

- **Coins** — `level × COINS_PER_LEVEL − Σ spent`, where spent of an owned item is
  `buy_cost + variant_cost_delta + Σ (cost of each purchased customization option) +
  progressive_surcharge(position)` (the surcharge is keyed to the holding's stable
  position, so the balance stays derived). Clamped to ≥ 0 (legacy gardens may show 0). A
  single legacy row at position 0 carries no surcharge and costs exactly the buy price — no
  retroactive spend.
- **Owned** — each holding with its `variant`, `customizations` (`{slot: option}`), and
  `available` slots (each option with its cost + `unlocked` / `affordable` / `applied`
  hints).
- **Shop** — every catalog item with `unlocked = level ≥ unlock_level`, a hint otherwise,
  and its `variants` (each with `cost_delta` + unlock state).
- **Vitality** — a thriving/dim flag from `current_streak_days`; visual only, never
  destructive.

## API

Layered route → service → model, user-scoped, default-deny (the standard checklist).

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/sanctuary` | coins, level, owned (variant + customizations + available slots), and the shop (with variants) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/sanctuary/buy` | `{ item_key, variant?, name? }` → buy a fresh item (optional name plaque) · `404` unknown item/variant · `409` locked or too poor · `422` bad shape / over-length name |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/sanctuary/items/{id}/customize` | `{ slot, option }` → apply a customization · `404` not yours / unknown slot+option · `409` locked, already-applied, or too poor · `422` bad shape |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/sanctuary/items/{id}` | `{ name?, note?, favorite? }` → set/clear cosmetic personalization (partial update; empty/null clears name/note); never changes coins · `404` not yours · `422` bad shape / over-length |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/sanctuary/items/{id}/move` | `{ cell }` → move to a grid cell (layout only — never touches `position` or pricing); swaps with whatever occupies the cell · `404` not yours · `422` bad shape / out-of-bounds cell |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/sanctuary/items/{id}/reset` | (no body) → clear the item's customizations back to its base form for a flat fee (ADR-0019); the sunk cost is refunded via the derived balance, minus the fee; the `variant` is kept · `404` not yours · `409` nothing to reset or concurrent conflict |

The `customize` and `buy` writes validate the level requirement and the **balance** before
committing; `move` is layout-only and never changes the balance. All request bodies reject
unexpected fields. The old `/upgrade` (tier ladder) route is removed in favour of
`/customize`. `move` swaps cells atomically in one transaction (the moving row is parked on
a temporary out-of-range sentinel cell to avoid tripping `UNIQUE(user_id, cell)`), and
returns the updated scene.

## Frontend

- **Where:** a compact scene renders on the **dashboard** (the home you land on), so
  the garden is the first thing you see; a dedicated **`/sanctuary` page** (nav button,
  shipped in Phase 3) gives the full view with the completion celebration.
- **Render:** **procedural SVG** (`components/SanctuaryPlant.tsx`) — each catalog item is
  drawn from its `variant` + `customizations`, each of which is a *real* visual change
  (fruit/blossom/autumn leaves, a swing or birdhouse on a tree, lilies/koi/a bridge on a
  pond, smoke from a chimney, garden beds, warm lights, a hat/collar/bandana on a pet, the
  `grown` size). viewBox 0 0 80 80, flat style.
- **Buy:** items with more than one variant open a small **variant picker** modal (each
  form previewed) before purchase; single-form items buy directly.
- **Personalize:** each owned card has a calm "Personalize" panel. At the top, optional
  cosmetic touches ([ADR-0015](../decisions/0015-sanctuary-personalization-touches.md)) — a
  **name** plaque, a one-line **note**, and a **favourite** star — committed quietly on blur
  (an empty field clears it). Below, the slots and options with cost and `applied` / `locked`
  / `affordable` state — mix and match over time. Validate (affordable + unlocked) before
  submit; server errors surface as a toast.
- **Name at purchase:** the buy modal (multi-variant items) carries an optional name field;
  single-variant items keep their one-tap Buy with a quiet, optional "name it…" affordance, so
  naming is always available but never a nag. A named item shows its plaque first (the item /
  variant becomes a quiet subtitle) and a small star when favourited. The name field starts
  blank but offers each item's own **suggested example name** — an on-character placeholder
  ("e.g. Bramblewick" for the gnome) plus a 🎲 "suggest a name" shuffle that fills a random
  one from the item's pool ([ADR-0015](../decisions/0015-sanctuary-personalization-touches.md)).
  It's a suggestion, never a default — nothing is auto-assigned. The same hint + shuffle
  appears when renaming an owned item in the personalize panel.
- **Arrange:** the garden renders on a row-major **grid** (`GRID_COLUMNS = 4`, mirroring
  the backend) ordered by `cell`, so each user lays their garden out where they want it
  ([ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-sanctuary-grid-layout.md)). Desktop supports **drag-to-move**
  (native HTML5 DnD — no new deps); touch/keyboard use a **tap-to-pick-then-tap-target**
  fallback (HTML5 DnD is unreliable on touch). Moves are optimistic, reverting with an
  error toast on failure. Layout-only — moving never changes coins.
- **States:** loading / error / empty as usual; the empty scene invites a first purchase.

## Build order

Each step is independently shippable.

1. ✅ **Grow + scene, read-only** — `sanctuary_service` computes the starter plant's
   progress from practice; render it on the dashboard. No table yet (pure computed).
2. ✅ **Plant next** — `sanctuary_plantings` + migration, the `POST` write path, and a
   nature catalog (tree, flower, pond) with milestone unlocks. The full loop end to end,
   with a "choose what to grow next" beat and the assortment rendered on the dashboard.
3. ✅ **Builder UI** — a dedicated `/sanctuary` page (nav button) showing the full
   assortment, the growing plant's bar, a "choose what to grow next" beat with a
   completion celebration, and a just-planted pop animation; linked from the dashboard.
4. ✅ **Depth** — structures (hut, barn) and companions (bird, fox) tracks beyond
   nature; milestone unlocks by lifetime points **and** current streak (locked options
   shown with their hint); a streak-driven **vitality** (dormant / thriving /
   flourishing, visual-only).
5. ✅ **Procedural SVG render** — vector plants drawn from `progress`, replacing the
   ASCII (frontend-only, no API change).
6. ✅ **Personalization** — per-item **variants** chosen at purchase and independent,
   mix-and-match **customizations** bought over time, each a real SVG change; the tier
   ladder retired (`/upgrade` → `/customize`), `tier` folded into the `grown` slot. Still
   a derived balance, no wallet/ledger ([ADR-0012](../decisions/0012-sanctuary-personalization.md)).
7. ✅ **Movable grid layout** — a `cell` column (separate from the economy key `position`)
   + the `/move` endpoint let users arrange items on a grid by drag (desktop) or
   tap-to-place (touch). Layout-only; the economy is untouched
   ([ADR-0014](../decisions/0014-sanctuary-grid-layout.md)).
8. ✅ **Naming + personal touches** — an optional `name` plaque (set at purchase or anytime),
   a short `note`, and a `favourite` star, via a `PATCH /items/{id}` endpoint. All cosmetic,
   optional, and default-off — the derived balance is untouched
   ([ADR-0015](../decisions/0015-sanctuary-personalization-touches.md)).
9. ✅ **Shop expansion + economy retune** — a **whimsy** track of characterful garden friends
   and curios (+11 items), an optional cosmetic `blurb` per item, and a holistic economy
   retune (`COINS_PER_LEVEL` 70 → 80, `PROGRESSIVE_STEP` 8 → 6) for a steadier purchase cadence
   under the front-loaded XP curve. Both economy levers move in the safe (generous) direction,
   so no existing garden's derived balance can be driven negative
   ([ADR-0016](../decisions/0016-sanctuary-shop-expansion-and-retune.md)).
10. ✅ **Growth ladder + dress-up slots** — the `grown` size slot becomes a four-stage,
    level-gated ladder (`grown → flourishing → mature → ancient`), each stage costlier and
    visibly larger/lusher in SVG; the characters gain additive `headwear` / `collar` /
    `attire` slots. The first rung stays keyed `"grown"` at the unchanged cost, so legacy
    rows are preserved exactly; the catalog is in-code, so no migration
    ([ADR-0019](../decisions/0019-sanctuary-growth-ladder-and-accessory-slots.md)).

## Out of scope (here)

Stripe cosmetic packs (a [monetization](../../docs/future-features.md#payments--monetization)
